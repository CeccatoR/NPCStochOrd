## NonParametric Combination (NPC) methodology for Stochastic Ordering problems

R codes implementing permutation-based tests intended to deal with stochastic ordering in the presence of univariate and multivariate data. NonParametric Combination (NPC) methodology (Pesarin and Salmaso, 2010) provides indeed a straightforward solution to compare C>1 independent populations (Arboretti et al., 2021). The user is required to provide the specific order he want to test and is allowed to choose among two different test statistics and three different possible combining functions.
